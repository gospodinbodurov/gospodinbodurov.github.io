        <h2>When ego fades, truth remains</h2>
        
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>I've been reflecting on what to write about this topic for quite a while. Previously, I explored how <a target = "_blank" href = "https://bodurov.net/mundane-tasks.html">life itself is the ultimate test</a> and discussed the challenges of balancing personal and professional priorities. Now, I’ve decided to focus on personal limits and growth.</p>

<p>There’s a popular belief that advancing in your career or business starts with self-improvement—and it’s true to an extent. However, a common misconception is that growth can be achieved simply by following coaches, taking courses, or, worse, buying into influencers’ flashy promises to "hack" your mindset with quick fixes and hype-driven programs.</p>

<p>The reality is far less glamorous but much more effective: genuine improvement comes from facing and overcoming real challenges or personal struggles. It’s through this process that our ego matures and authentic growth takes root.</p>

<h4>Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one</h4>
<p>I’m speaking from personal experience. At the age of 11, I was diagnosed with <a target = "_blank" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis">acute pancreatitis</a>—a condition with a staggering between 40 and 70% mortality rate. I spent 40 harrowing days in the hospital, battling persistent fever, temperatures soaring above 39.5°C, and constant vomiting. Even the Head of Surgery lost hope, telling my mother I wouldn’t survive. But, against all odds, I pulled through.</p>

<p>After being discharged, my recovery was far from easy. For nearly four years, I had to adhere to an incredibly strict diet, limited mostly to baked chicken breast, rice, and potatoes. This challenging period had a profound impact on my life; for example, I didn’t have my first alcoholic drink until I was 19. The psychological recovery was equally difficult, taking months to overcome lingering fears and phobias.</p>

<h4>Hard times create strong men</h4>
<p>To this day, I have no idea why it happened. The doctors said it was a virus, but even now, I feel a chill run down my spine when I think about the experience. It was terrifying—easily the scariest moment of my life—and the panic and horror are etched deeply into my soul. That day changed me. It made me realize I wanted more out of life, that there’s nothing more profound than surviving something that feels so final. In such a case even an office job doesn’t seem so unappealing anymore.</p>

<p>
Finally, this was the first time I truly understood our own mortality. Many young people believe they're invincible—until the person next to them unexpectedly collapses. Others live in a bubble, where everything is handed to them, and even the smallest challenges seem overwhelming. The reality is, human beings are incredibly resilient. Most of our limitations exist only in our minds. Throughout history, humanity has faced countless obstacles and always found a way to endure. By comparison, the challenges of modern life often feel insignificant.
</p>

<p>
But let’s circle back to the opening point: life advice should only come from those who’ve lived it and bear the scars of their experiences. Anything else is just empty talk. And remember, tough times reveal true character. It's in these moments you discover who your real friends are and who isn’t.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This experience has shaped my entire life. It’s why I took the initiative to teach myself computer science and programming. It’s why I began coaching others. It’s why I juggled full-time work while pursuing my university studies. It’s why I remain composed in challenging situations, rarely giving in to panic. It’s why I poured my efforts into developing <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.s-3.team/initiatives/platform.html">our platform</a> and giving limitless possibilities to start-up founders.</p> 

<p>
I firmly believe that we shoud be the architects of our own destiny, defining the boundaries of what is possible and that knowing ourselves is the beginning of all wisdom.
